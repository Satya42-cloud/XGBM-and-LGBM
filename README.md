# XGBM-and-LGBM
## Comparative Analysis of LightGBM and XGBoost on Titanic Dataset

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to compare the performance of LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) and XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) algorithms on the Titanic dataset. This involves performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.

### Dataset
- Dataset: Titanic dataset, which contains passenger information and survival status. The dataset is used to predict survival outcomes based on various features.

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Data Loading:
- Load the Titanic dataset using Pythonâ€™s Pandas library.
#### Missing Values:
- Check for missing values and assess their impact on the analysis.
#### Data Distribution:
- Explore data distributions using histograms and box plots to understand the distribution of features.
#### Feature Relationships:
- Visualize relationships between features and survival outcomes using scatter plots and bar plots to uncover patterns.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
##### Missing Value Imputation:
- Impute missing values using suitable techniques to ensure completeness of the dataset.
#### Categorical Variable Encoding:
- Encode categorical variables using one-hot encoding or label encoding to make them suitable for machine learning models.
#### Additional Preprocessing:
- Apply any additional preprocessing methods if required to improve model performance.

### 3. Building Predictive Models
#### Data Splitting:
- Split the preprocessed dataset into training and testing sets to enable model evaluation.
#### Evaluation Metrics:
- Choose appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for assessing model performance.
#### Model Building:
- Build predictive models using LightGBM and XGBoost algorithms.
#### Model Training and Evaluation:
- Train the models on the training set and evaluate their performance on the testing set.
#### Model Optimization:
- Use techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance and ensure robust results.

### 4. Comparative Analysis
#### Performance Comparison:
- Compare the performance metrics of LightGBM and XGBoost models, focusing on accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.
#### Visualization and Interpretation:
- Visualize and interpret the results to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm, providing insights into their comparative effectiveness.
